Addons are located inside the addons folder. Each addon is inside its own folder as well. In order to tell the addon loader how the addon plans to work, addons use a standard addon.json file located at the root of the addon&amp;rsquo;s folder.</description></item><item><title>Design</title><link>https://scratchaddons.com/docs/reference/design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scratchaddons.com/docs/reference/design/</guid><description>Icons We use iconify UIL (Unicons) icons.
